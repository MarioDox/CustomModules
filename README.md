# CustomModules
A repository holding module edits for Super Smash Bros. Brawl for public use.
Utilizes [reltools](https://github.com/Sammi-Husky/reltools) for decompiling/compiling.

-------------------

Each module will be compiled with the source, with an additional document with explainations and defining compatibility.

Any added / modified / new lines are easy to search, their offset starts with *"XXXXXXXX"*.

New functions will be start with the prefix *"custom_"*.

-------------------

Plug and Play files will be located in their unique folder in the source called "Addons".
They may require edits on the original functions to be transplanted over.
These changes will be notified in the documentation.

## Credits
Any file in here can be used for any of purpose, as long as it's not for profit.

Only credit is necessary. Credits are defined in the document file inside the module folder.

Huge thanks for Sammi Husky for reltools and Kapedani for lots of help early on.
